# Smart Home Project :house_with_garden:	
An home automation enviroment in wich an Android application interfaces with an Arduino in orded to control lights, security, doors, sensors... .
The idea is to have an appliction that uses http methods to dialogue with esp01 modules, which can turn on and off multiple devices.
Each esp01 controls a relay module and has an ip address so it can be reached through local wifi network.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Hardware
- Android smartphone
- Esp01/Esp01s relay module
- 5v power supply

## :computer: Software
- Arduino IDE (for esp01)
- Android Studio (for Android app)
